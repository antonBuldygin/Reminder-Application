<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will create the basic skeleton for the reminder application. We will use Swing to create the GUI for our application.</p>

<p>In Swing, we create the window using JFrame. You should extend this class and make modifications to its size and placement on screen as per your requirements.</p>

<p>JFrame, which comes from the <strong>javax.swing</strong> package, creates the main window where we will place our menus, buttons, images, gifs etc.</p>

<p>The setSize() method is used to define a size for our window where the first parameter is the width of window and second parameter is its height.</p>

<p>To set location for the application window, we use the setLocation() method. It takes 2 parameters and places the application window at given location of our computer screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By default, if you try to close the window using the red X button then it would just disappear from the screen and keep running in the background. To avoid this from happening, you need to set a default behavior whenever a window is being closed which can be done by calling the setDefaultCloseOperation() and passing &quot;EXIT_ON_CLOSE&quot; to it.</p>

<p>Below is an example of how to use this information in your code :</p>

<pre>
<code><samp>JFrame f = new JFrame(&quot;Your Title&quot;);
f.setSize(500, 300);
f.setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
f.setLocation(1250, 500);</samp></code></pre>

<p>Once you have a window set up , you can add buttons, dropdown menus as required. For this project, you can use JLabel to show text right next to dropdowns and JPanel to divide your GUI into multiple parts.</p>

<p>Other components list and use can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://zetcode.com/javaswing/basicswingcomponentsII/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://zetcode.com/javaswing/basicswingcomponents/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a program that would resemble the basic look of the reminder application that you want to create. The application must be able to minimize and close completely on pressing the exit button.</p>

<p>Note: Find out how to disable the maximize button for the application window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Create a window and give it the&nbsp;<code>Reminder Application</code>&nbsp;title.&nbsp; The window size should be 500*300.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The window should contain the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>JButton</code>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<code>AddReminder</code>&nbsp;name.</li>
  <li><code>JButton</code>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<code>EditReminder</code>&nbsp;name.</li>
  <li><code>JButton</code>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<code>DeleteReminder</code>&nbsp;name.</li>
  <li><code>JList</code>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<code>List of Reminders</code>&nbsp;name.</li>
  <li><code>JScrollPane</code>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<code>Scroll Pane</code>&nbsp;name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enable the components and make them visible. The JScrollPane size shouls be 480*100.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To set a name to an element, use the&nbsp;<code>setName()</code>&nbsp;method.</p>
